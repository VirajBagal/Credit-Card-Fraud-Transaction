# Credit-Card-Fraud-Transaction
EDA + TSNE +SMOTE + ENSEMBLING
Our world is heading towards cashless economy and so it is increasingly important to track fraudulent transactions.
I am using the dataset from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
As expected, the dataset is highly imbalanced. So, this is the challenge to build a model to detect fraudulent transactions.
I followed the following steps:
1.EDA
2.Train Test Split
3.Feature Scaling
4.SMOTE for minority class
5.TSNE
6.Trained multiple models
7.Ensembled them with XGBClassifier
